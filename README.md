This repository contains a tiny demo Android application showcasing how to integrate a Rust library into an Android project using JNI (Java Native Interface). The Rust library provides a simple string reverser function, demonstrating how to call native Rust code from Android Kotlin/Java.

âœ… Key features:

Minimal setup to connect Rust and Android
Example Rust function that reverses a string
Kotlin code calling Rust via JNI
Working build scripts for both Rust and Android
The main goal of this project is to serve as a starting point or reference for developers interested in adding Rust code to their Android applications.
